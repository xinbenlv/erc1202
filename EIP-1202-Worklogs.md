## Note to Readers

1. We are still open to have co-author to collaborate, in particular, we are looking for co-authors of the 
following category:
 - standard designers who are experienced in application-layer standard design, or 
 - developers who have experience with blockchain-based voting system in practice
 - researchers with research interest in crypto/zero-knowledge-proof voting
 

2. We have two discussion destinations: 
 - [Github Ethereum EIP Issue #1202](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1202) for long and more mature thoughts
 - [Telegram Channel t.me/erc1202](https://t.me/erc1202) for real-time and related random chat.
 
3. We are actively working on updating this draft as many feedbacks have come in since it merged into official EIP repo.
